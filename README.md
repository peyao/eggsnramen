=================

Our webapp uses the Ionic framework which makes developing a mobile web page very easy.

Check this page out especially for Ionic documentation:

We also use SASS/SCSS.

If you don't know what it is, check this out: http://sass-lang.com/guide

I recommend using Brackets editor, it makes editing HTML and general web dev documents much easier - or you can keep using Sublime or whatever. If you do use Brackets, installed the Extension called 'Brackets SASS' which automatically compiles .scss files to .css.

Basically, we won't be editing a .css file, but rather a .scss, which when you have Brackets SASS or another SCSS compiler, will convert your .scss file to a .css file immediately after each time you save.

What to edit?

After cloning/pulling this repo, go into the 'www' directory. This is where our website exists. The index.html is served to the user by default.

In our index.html, it calls a template called 'tab-dash.html' which is located in the 'www/tempates' directory. Editing 'tab-dash.html' will allow you to change our site dashboard.

Opening the index.html may not actually display anything. If you're using Brackets, use the 'Live Preview' function located at the right of the editor.
